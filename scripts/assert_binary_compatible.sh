# 10.9 userland compat guard for one or more shipped Mach-O binaries.
# Per binary: (1) no post-10.9 UNDEFINED import, (2) arch exactly x86_64,
# (3) LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX == 10.9. Fail-closed if nothing measured.
#
# This is what makes a newer-SDK cross-build trustworthy: the newer SDK will
# happily let you link post-10.9 symbols that simply are not present on a real
# Mavericks box, and this catches them before they ship.
#
# Knobs:
#   MAVERICKS_POST_10_9_SYMBOLS    extra post-10.9 symbols (grep -E alternation) that must
#                                  not appear as undefined imports.
#   MAVERICKS_REQUIRE_DEFINED_SYMBOLS  symbols that MUST be DEFINED (a project's 10.9 shims).
#   MAVERICKS_ALLOW_GUARDED_WEAK   grep -E alternation of post-10.9 symbols permitted ONLY when
#                                  imported *weak*. For runtimes (e.g. mavericks-swift) that
#                                  weak-link post-10.9 SPIs and NULL-check them before use
#                                  (Swift's SWIFT_RUNTIME_WEAK_CHECK). Default empty => strict:
#                                  ANY post-10.9 undefined fails, weak or not (original behavior).
#                                  A HARD post-10.9 import ALWAYS fails, allowlisted or not --
#                                  10.9's dyld-239 aborts on a missing *hard* lazy symbol, and it
#                                  also aborts on a missing *weak* lazy symbol that is actually
#                                  called, so the allowlist is an assertion that the runtime
#                                  guards these with a NULL-check.
