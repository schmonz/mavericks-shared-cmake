# Mavericks.cmake -- shared build conventions for the mavericks-* family.
#
# These projects all build native artifacts that run on OS X 10.9 "Mavericks"
# and cross-build for it from a modern macOS on GitHub Actions. This module
# centralizes what that takes; each project keeps its own targets/packaging.
#
# Usage (in a project CMakeLists.txt): every mavericks-* project can include this.
#

#   find_package(MavericksSharedCMake REQUIRED)   # sets up CMAKE_MODULE_PATH

# Deployment target + architecture must be set BEFORE project() to take effect, so
# they come from your preset (inherit mavericks-native / mavericks-cross from
# mavericks-presets.json) -- NOT from this umbrella, which runs after project(). A
# project on a non-Apple toolchain sets(MAVERICKS_REQUIRE_APPLECLANG OFF) first.
# Install once with `cmake --install` (self-registers); see README.

# project() via the preset -- this umbrella runs too late to set them.)
